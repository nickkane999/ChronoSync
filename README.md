# ChronoSync

Script Library to track when activities are ready to review / start
Tabs allow users to define and start timers. Additionally, users can assign macros to complete activities

# Purpose
In the past many scripts I had were located in separate folders, each one made to handle different cases. By combining and updating these files to use for 1 application, it has become easier to refernce scripts and load/switch between the macros using an UI. 

# Future Use
I have added some scripts, but many have not been added; right now I do not need to use many of these scripts. When I find myself needed to use an old macro / script not located here, I will add it to the repo and note what it is used for.
