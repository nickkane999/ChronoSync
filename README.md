# ChronoSync
Script Library to track when activities are ready to review/start. Tabs allow users to define and start timers, and assign macros to complete activities.

## Purpose
In the past, many of my scripts were located in separate folders, each handling different cases. By combining and updating these scripts into a single application, it has become easier to reference and switch between macros using a UI.

## Future Use
I have added some scripts, but many have yet to be included. Currently, I don't need to use many of these scripts. However, when I find the need to use an old macro or script that isnâ€™t already included, I will add it to the repo and note its purpose.
